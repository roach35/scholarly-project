    "## Data Collection and Feature Engineering\n",
    "Before any modeling was performed, the necessary data was collected using two distinct platforms. The first data that was collected was Twitter data. This was done using the Twitter Developer API, as well as the `tweepy` module. Tweets containing the word \"bitcoin\" were streamed for several days. This data was written to a `.pkl` file, and saved for later feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other data that was collected was the value of a single Bitcoin. During the same interval (plus twenty-four hours after the last Tweet was recorded) that the Twitter data was collected, the value of a Bitcoin was recorded each minute, along with the corresponding time stamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Twitter and Bitcoin data was recorded, further feature engineering was employed. For each Tweet stored, the corresponding price of Bitcoin at the time the Tweet was made was added as the `inital_price` for the Tweet. Then, for each Tweet, if the price of Bitcoin increased within twenty-four hours of the time the Tweet was made, the feature `increase` was assigned a value of `1`. Otherwise, `increase` is assigned the value of `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for each Tweet recorded, the text of that Tweet is cleaned and standardized. This cleaned Tweet is then BERTified, and a vector of length 512 is returned. This vector is stored as the `bertified` feature. Only the `bertified` and `increase` features are kept, and these form the training data to be used in this notebook."
